# Carambah Solution Architecture Overview

## Core Concept

Carambah is the solution composition component within the Quartet Architecture, responsible for building comprehensive solutions from SPlectrum execution assets and InfoMetis packaged services.

## The Quartet Architecture Flow

1. **SPlectrum** - Creates packages from JavaScript execution engine and unified API management
2. **Carambah** - Composes SPlectrum packages into executable entities ("exe" type solutions)
3. **InfoMetis** - Generically wraps Carambah solutions for deployment and management
4. **Sesameh** - Provides behavioral AI components for adaptive management styles

## Solution Structure

### Vanilla Solutions
- Generic specification and configuration without instance-specific details
- Composable architecture supporting both solution parts and complete solutions
- No integrations, authorizations, or operational specifics included

### Solution Instances
- Created by adding configuration overlay to vanilla solutions
- Include instance-specific configuration (integrations, auth, operational settings)
- Managed as git repositories containing operational data from management operations
- Likely implemented as Carambah repo clones with configuration overlay insertion

## InfoMetis Integration

### Third-Party Service Components
- InfoMetis manages repositories for external tools (Elastic, Nifi, Kafka, etc.)
- These are complete solutions running external code, not simple executables
- Service components where external code execution occurs

### Solution Wrapping
- InfoMetis provides generic wrapping for Carambah solutions
- All solutions treated as same type for management purposes
- Enables consistent deployment and operational management

## AI-Enhanced Management

### Sesameh Integration
- Behavioral AI components can be added to solution repo instances
- Enables specific management styles tailored to operational needs
- AI components already operational in development repositories

## Build and Release Process

### Asset Generation
- Solution releases trigger build of packaging assets
- Some assets built on-demand to optimize workload
- InfoMetis wrapper compatibility specified in solution definitions

### Packaging Requirements
- Solutions require InfoMetis packaging (container/exe/wrapper) to run
- Carambah solutions specify component setup and InfoMetis wrapper compatibility
- Release process coordinates asset building across the ecosystem

## Solution Specification and Versioning

### Component Versioning
- Carambah solutions specify all constituent parts by explicit version
- Solution builder must know how to fetch versioned components
- Version transitions are explicit and require complete retesting
- All components maintained in controlled repositories to prevent uncontrolled functionality drift

### Repository Control Strategy
- Use own repositories for all components (higher maintenance burden accepted)
- Ensures controlled evolution and prevents external dependency drift
- Maintains architectural integrity across the solution ecosystem

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Test Suite Requirements
- Solutions have specifications that must be testable
- Comprehensive test suites required for all solution components
- Version transitions mandate full regression testing
- Testing validates both individual components and composed solutions

### Validation Process
- Specification-driven testing ensures solution compliance
- Component integration testing validates composition correctness
- Version upgrade testing verifies transition safety

## AI Component Integration

### Temperament and Workflow Matching
- AI components must have appropriate temperament for solution context
- Workflows must align with solution operational requirements
- Sesameh AI components tailored to specific management styles needed

### Behavioral Consistency
- AI behavior must be consistent with solution purpose
- Management workflows adapted to solution operational patterns
- AI temperament selection critical for effective solution operation
