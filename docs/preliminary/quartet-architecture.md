# The Quartet Architecture

## Overview

The Quartet Architecture represents a comprehensive ecosystem for solution development and deployment, with each component serving a distinct role in the solution lifecycle.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **SPlectrum** - Execution Engine (How to Execute)
- JavaScript execution engine that manages APIs of core libraries, tools and DSL applications
- Provides seamless scripting environment through unified API management
- Foundation for runtime execution of packaged solutions

### 2. **InfoMetis** - Packaging System (How to Package)
- Packaging system for SPlectrum and other services
- Enables composition of services into deployable solutions
- Handles service orchestration and dependency management

### 3. **Sesameh** - AI Intelligence (How to Adapt)
- AI intelligence layer for adaptive solution behavior
- Provides intelligent automation and decision-making capabilities
- Enables solutions to adapt and optimize based on context and usage

### 4. **Carambah** - Solution Composition (How to Compose)
- Solution composition repository (this repository)
- Constructs comprehensive solutions from SPlectrum and InfoMetis assets
- Orchestrates the integration of packaged services into complete solutions

## Integration Flow

```
SPlectrum (Execute) → InfoMetis (Package) → Sesameh (Adapt) → Carambah (Compose)
```

## Organizational Context

This quartet provides a complete solution development ecosystem where:
- **SPlectrum** provides the execution foundation
- **InfoMetis** handles service packaging and composition
- **Sesameh** adds intelligent adaptation capabilities
- **Carambah** orchestrates everything into complete solutions
